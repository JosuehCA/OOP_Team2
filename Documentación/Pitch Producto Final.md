# ***Pitch for Product Demonstration (10-Minute Duration)***

## ***(Introduction)***

Welcome back. Today holds immense significance for our team — it's a day when we reveal the culmination of months of dedication and hard work. 
Let me proudly present to you the Proof of Concept (POC) of **SeafoodTrace**, our efficient automated inventory system. But before we jump into the demo, let's rewind a bit and explore the inspiration that led us on this exciting journey.

**[Recap the captivating story briefly, emphasizing the challenges observed during the visit to the seafood processing plant.]**

Let's go back to where it all began — our visit to a busy seafood processing plant in Chelem, Yucatan. Imagine this: thousands of kilos of freshly caught fish, a daily export to the United States. The real challenge? The freezer management, relying on manual reports and paper records. That's when it clicked for us — a software solution could transform this process, making it more efficient and accurate. And so, our journey to create that solution began.

Inspired by the challenges facing the industry, our team conceptualized and developed an innovative automated inventory system. Today we present not just a POC; we're showcasing a real solution for the stakeholder.

Now, let's transition to the groundbreaking solution we've developed to address these challenges.


## ***(Product Overview)***

As we get into the heart of our presentation, let me provide you a overview of our automated inventory system. We have combined RFID technology with a practical object-oriented software system, all linked to a robust database to create a solution that will come to offer real-time tracking, precise control and a streamlined approach to managing perishable products in a freezer.

**[Highlight key features and functionalities of the system.]**

Let's look deeper into the key features and functionalities that make **SeafoodTrace** a game-changer for seafood preservation.

1. **Automated management of inputs and outputs:**

The system streamlines the task of managing inputs and outputs within the freezer. Thanks to RFID technology, it ensures accurate tracking and recording of the path of each batch, from the moment it enters the facility to its final destination.

2. **Precise control and optimized management:**

The heart of our system lies in providing precise inventory control. It optimizes management by cataloging crucial details in a centralized database, including inbound dates, supplier information, designated lots, product species and outbound dates.

3. **Reporting and Alerts System:**

The user will have a section where they will be automatically notified if a marine product is about to expire. This feature is not just a part of our software; it's one of the key things that make our system incredibly helpful. It ensures that you're always in the loop, making timely decisions to keep your seafood products fresh and of the highest quality. It's like having a friendly reminder right when you need it the most.

4. **Creation of documents for product management:**

The user has the option to print a PDF file directly from the web interface. This feature translates into a seamless process of printing the list of products that made their way into the freezer. Initially identified by the RFID reader, seamlessly entering our database. Now, you can effortlessly print it for your documentation needs.

## ***(Objectives)***

**[Reminder of project objectives.]**

Now, as a riminder, it's essential to understand the objectives we set out to achieve with this project.

- **Optimizing inventory management**
- **Ensure precise control.**
- **Minimizing product losses.**
- **Enhancing traceability.** 
- **Achieve time and cost savings.**
- **Improving decision-making for perishable products.**

## ***(Project Development Overview)***

Building impactful software products is a journey, not a sprint. Today, I'm thrilled to walk you through the transformative stages of our project's evolution. It is essential to point out that this process was developed in three distinct stages: the inception phase, the coding phase, and the triumphant completion phase, culminating in the POC.

So, before the demonstration of our POC, let's venture into the past, in the project's development stages.

### *First Delivery:*

Let's rewind to the inception of our project, where we laid down the essential groundwork. We meticulously defined every aspect surrounding our product, including its description, objectives, scope, and value proposition. Additionally, we pinned down both functional and non-functional requirements, presenting an initial version of class and use case diagrams. Accompanied by a video pitch detailing our project vision, we introduced an automated input and output system to manage perishable product inventory in a processing plant. 

### *Second Delivery:*

As we progressed to the second delivery, substantial modifications shaped the project. We refined requirements definitions and adjusted class and use case diagrams. Notably, we fine-tuned the reporting feature and commenced the coding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) in Python. Simultaneously, we worked on the User Interface (UI) using the Django framework.

### *Final Delivery:*

The final delivery marked a substantial coding effort for the MVC. We transitioned to coding the project in Java, opting for the SpringBoot framework for the web UI. The defined program requirements were flawlessly implemented, and RFID technology was successfully integrated. The result? A fully functional software product automatically recording entries and exits in a robust database.

### **Introduction to the Demo:**

And now, I'm excited to walk you through a demonstration of our POC in action. 

Introducing **SeafoodTrace**

(Video plays)

As you can see, the final implementation of our product is an impressive, efficient inventory automation process. 
Imagine taking this POC to the next level and transforming it into a system that reads thousands of batches of product.

### **User Interface Overview:**

*(Display the user interface of our system, highlighting its user-friendly design and intuitive features.)*

Let's take a quick look at our user interface – the face of our system. Designed with simplicity in mind, our interface is user-friendly and packed with intuitive features. We've built it using SpringBoot, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for our users. From easy navigation to clear functionalities, our interface is crafted to make the user experience smooth and enjoyable.

### **RFID Technology in Action:**

*(Showcase how RFID technology enables real-time tracking of fish batches, emphasizing accuracy and efficiency.)*

We're going to see a little bit of RFID technology in action, this little device is known as the RFID USB Reader and it works at a speed of 13.56 Mhz, which means it's short range.
Now I'll put this RFID ID card in and we'll see what happens.

### **Database Integration:**

*(Demonstrate the seamless integration with a centralized database)*

Let's talk about one crucial aspect: database integration. Overall, our database, powered by the SpringBoot framework, is seamlessly managed through a repository. This means that our system stores and retrieves data efficiently, ensuring a smooth and reliable flow of information. Currently, there are two tables to run SeafodTrace, one table dedicated to products, and another table linking an RFID identifier to each product.

## ***(Closing)***

Finally, we appreciate your time spent watching this presentation. We look forward to continuing our work and taking the next steps in the implementation of our product.
As we conclude this presentation, I want to express our gratitude for your time and kind attention.
