# ***Pitch for Product Demonstration (10-Minute Duration)***

## ***(Introduction)***

Welcome back. Today holds immense significance for our teamwork — it's a day when we reveal the culmination of months of dedication and hard work. 
Let me proudly present to you the Proof of Concept (POC) of **SeafoodTrace**, our efficient automated inventory system. But before we jump into the demo, let's rewind a bit and explore the inspiration that led us on this exciting journey.

**[Recap the captivating story briefly, emphasizing the challenges observed during the visit to the seafood processing plant.]**

Let's go back to where it all began — our visit to a busy seafood processing plant in Chelem, Yucatan. Imagine this: thousands of kilos of freshly caught fish, a daily export to the United States. The real challenge? The freezer management, relying on manual reports and paper records. That's when it clicked for us — a software solution could transform this process, making it more efficient and accurate. And so, our journey to create that solution began.

Inspired by the challenges facing the industry, our team conceptualized and developed an innovative automated inventory system. Today we present not just a POC; we're showcasing a real solution for the stakeholder.

Now, let's transition to the groundbreaking solution we've developed to address these challenges.


## ***(Product Overview and Objectives)***

As we get into the heart of our presentation, let me provide you a overview of our automated inventory system. We have combined RFID technology with a practical object-oriented software system, all linked to a robust database to create a solution that will come to offer real-time tracking, precise control and a streamlined approach to managing perishable products in a freezer.

**[Highlight key features and functionalities of the system.]**

Let's look deeper into the key features and functionalities that make **SeafoodTrace** a game-changer for seafood preservation.

1. **Automated management of inputs and outputs:**

The system streamlines the task of managing inputs and outputs within the freezer. Thanks to RFID technology, it ensures accurate tracking and recording of the path of each batch, from the moment it enters the facility to its final destination.

2. **Precise control and optimized management:**

The heart of our system lies in providing precise inventory control. It optimizes management by cataloging crucial details in a centralized database, including inbound dates, supplier information, designated lots, product species and outbound dates.

3. **Reporting and Alerts System:**

The user will have a section where they will be automatically notified if a marine product is about to expire. This feature is not just a part of our software; it's one of the key things that make our system incredibly helpful. It ensures that you're always in the loop, making timely decisions to keep your seafood products fresh and of the highest quality. It's like having a friendly reminder right when you need it the most.

**[Reminder of project objectives.]**

Before we proceed with the demonstration of our POC, it's essential to understand the objectives we set out to achieve with this project.
Our primary goals included optimizing inventory management, minimizing product losses, enhancing traceability, and improving decision-making for perishable products. Now, let's explore how the Proof of Concept aligns with these objectives.

- **Introduction to the Demo:**

And now, I'm excited to walk you through a demonstration of our POC in action. Introducing **SeafoodTrace**

- **User Interface Overview:**

*(Display the user interface of our system, highlighting its user-friendly design and intuitive features.)*

Let's take a quick look at our user interface – the face of our system. Designed with simplicity in mind, our interface is user-friendly and packed with intuitive features. We've built it using SpreenBoot, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for our users. From easy navigation to clear functionalities, our interface is crafted to make the user experience smooth and enjoyable.

- **RFID Technology in Action:**

*(Showcase how RFID technology enables real-time tracking of fish batches, emphasizing accuracy and efficiency.)*

- **Database Integration:**

*(Demonstrate the seamless integration with a centralized database, emphasizing the ease of confirming entry dates, product suppliers, designated batches, product species, and exit dates.)*

- **Efficiency and Automation:**

*(Highlight how our system automates previously manual tasks, reducing workload and potential errors.)*

- **Scalability:**

*(Discuss the system's scalability and adaptability of the system,showing and explaining parts of the code.)*

Our software as a versatile tool that uses the best features of object-oriented programming, like "inheritance" and "polymorphism". This means that if we ever need to add new functions to the SeafoodTrace system, it'll be easier and more flexible, ensuring seamless growth and adaptability in the future."
