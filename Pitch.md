## ***(Start with a captivating story)***
Imagine a seafood processing company that receives thousands of pounds of freshly caught fish daily for export to the United States. In this fast-paced world, keeping track of every batch of products entering and leaving the freezer.

Indeed, such an establishment is real and can be found in Chelem, Yucatan. During a visit to that processing plant, we witnessed the extraordinary work they do.  As the employees explained the storage process in the freezer using bored reports and paper records, we realized there was an opportunity for improvement.

## ***(Product description)***
We have devised an automated input and output system to control the inventory of perishable products within a canning facility, incorporating RFID technology. This system enables accurate monitoring and efficient management of items cataloged in a database, facilitating the confirmation of entry dates, product suppliers, designated batches, product species, and exit dates.
We've harnessed the power of RFID technology to make this vision a reality.


Our objectives for this project are:

+ Optimization of inventory management.
* Precise inventory control.
+ Minimization of product losses.
* Facilitate traceability.
+ Time and cost savings.
* Improved decision making in perishable products.
+ Improved customer satisfaction.


# ***(Value proposition)***
The goal of our product is to streamline and simplify operations for a perishable product exporter, with a specific focus on food freezer management. 

What sets our project apart is the seamless integration of RFID technology. This allows for real-time tracking of fish batches, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and reducing the margin of error to nearly zero. This innovation promises to transform how inventory is managed at the client company.

Importantly, we offer numerous benefits, such as reduced workload for cannery employees and administrative departments, improved process efficiency, increased monitoring of cannery products and, most importantly, increased profits and reduced waste.




## ***(Conclution)***
In conclusion, our automated inventory system represents a transformative solution for our client's needs. By implementing RFID technology, we offer a way to manage inventory in real time, efficiently and very accurately. This innovation will not only simplify your operations, but also reduce errors to almost zero, ensuring the integrity of your product supply chain.

This project is not just about inventory, it is about increasing our client's productivity and profits. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and bring significant improvements to your inventory management process. Thank you for your kind attention.
