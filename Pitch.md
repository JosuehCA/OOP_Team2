## ***(Start with a captivating story)***
Could you imagine a seafood processing company that receives thousands of pounds of freshly caught fish daily for export to the United States, from all around the globe? In this fast-paced world, keeping track of every batch of products going in and out of huge freezing containers nonstop EVERY DAY? 

Indeed, such an establishment is real and can be found in Chelem, Yucatan. During a visit to that processing plant, we witnessed the extraordinary work they do. However, as the employees explained the storage process in the freezer using manual reports and paper records, we realized there was an opportunity for improvement, and so did they. Together, we decided it was time for a change.

## ***(Product description)***
Given the circumstances, our team has come up with the idea of an automated input and output system to control the inventory of perishable products within the facility, incorporating RFID technology and taking full use of its great potential using Radiofrequency waves. This system would enable accurate monitoring and efficient management of items cataloged in a database, facilitating the confirmation of entry dates, product suppliers, designated batches, product species, and exit dates.
We've harnessed the power of RFID technology to make this vision a reality, leaving the dirty work behind and automating almost all of it.


Our objectives for this project are:

+ Optimization of inventory management.
* Precise inventory control.
+ Minimization of product losses.
* Facilitate traceability.
+ Time and cost savings.
* Improved decision-making in perishable products.
+ Improved customer satisfaction.


# ***(Value proposition)***
The goal of our product is to streamline and simplify operations for a perishable product exporter, with a specific focus on food freezer management. And although our scope right now mainly targets food processing companies, the use cases for an inventory management system with such capable technology allow for a highly versatile software that could be implemented in various different fields with a few adjustements. 

What sets our project apart is the seamless integration of RFID technology. This allows for real-time tracking of fish batches, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and reducing the margin of error to nearly zero. This innovation promises to transform how inventory is managed at the client company.

With this in mind, we offer numerous other benefits, such as reduced workload for employees and administrative departments, improved process efficiency, increased monitoring rates of all products and, most importantly, increased profits and reduced waste.



## ***(Conclusion)***
In conclusion, our automated inventory system represents a fitting solution for our client's needs. By implementing RFID technology, we offer a way to manage inventory in real-time, efficiently, and very accurately. This innovation will not only simplify your operations, but also greatly reduce errors, ensuring the integrity of your product supply chain.

This project is not just about stocktaking. It is about increasing our client's productivity, making quality-of-life changes, and providing a safer and more scalable approach, both short and long-term wise. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and bring significant improvements to your inventory management process. Thank you for your kind attention.
